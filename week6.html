    <p>
i decided to use a capacitive sensor to measure the amount of water in a cup.
</p>
<p>
  here is a link to <a href="https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/Sensors/tx_rx_sensors/rx_tx02.txt">the code</a> that i used — though i did make
  a small correction in line 26, changing it to pinMode(tx_pin,OUTPUT);
  </p>
  <p>
    i then rigged up the circuit as such:
  </p>

<p>
i connected the alligator clips to the copper plates, which i taped to the sides of a cup. the two masking tape lines
correspond to 50mL and 150mL of water, which i measured out prior to attaching the plates.
</p>

<p>
i began pouring in water and seeing the corresponding change in capacitance on the serial plotter, which
i was able to calibrate due to the pre-measured quantities on the cup.

# piezo sensor

    <pre style="color:gray">
# ---------------------------------
  </pre>
    <p>
having already implemented a piezo sensor for my <a href="week4.html">week 4 assignment</a>, i decided to add upon
that setup by implementing a pattern-based knock recognition mechanism.
</p>
<p>
  if you'll recall, the previous mechanism would activate after a single knock above a certain threshold. 
</p>
<img src="images/mp6.gif">
<p>
for this week's assignment, my goal was to allow it to activate only after four knocks — one hard, two soft, and one hard.</p>
<p>
  this mainly required adjustments in the arduino code. this was my initial version:
</p>
<pre style="color:rgb(100, 209, 209)">
  const int sensor = A0;     
  const int A1A = 3;
  const int A1B = 4;

  int sensorReading = 0;

  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    Serial.begin(9600);
  }

  void loop() {
    sensorReading = analogRead(sensor);
    
    if (sensorReading >= 25) {
      digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);
      Serial.println(sensorReading);
      delay(3000);
      digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
      delay(3000);
      digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
      delay(3000);
      digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
i soon discovered that if i wanted to implement a pattern-based system, i would have to create a variable that 
would track the number of knocks and create different if statements that corresponded to the number of knocks that have already
been made. additionally, i would no longer be able to rely on the delay() function, and would have to use the 
millis() function to track time.
</p>
<p>
  after several rounds of iterations around these constraints, here was my new version:
</p>
<pre style="color:rgb(100, 209, 209)">
  const int sensor = A0;     
  const int A1A = 3;
  const int A1B = 4;
  
  int sensorReading = 0;
  int knocks = 0;         
  unsigned long previousTime = 0;
  
  long interval = 1000;
  
  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
      Serial.begin(9600);
  
  }
  
  void loop() {
    sensorReading = analogRead(sensor);
    unsigned long currentTime = millis();
  
    if (currentTime % 100){
      Serial.println(knocks);
    }
    
    if (sensorReading >= 100 and knocks == 0){
      knocks ++;
      previousTime = currentTime;
    } 
  
    if (knocks == 1 and currentTime - previousTime > interval and sensorReading >= 25){
      knocks ++;
      previousTime = currentTime;
    }
  
    if (knocks == 2 and currentTime - previousTime > interval and sensorReading >= 25){
      knocks ++;
      previousTime = currentTime;
    }
  
    if (knocks == 3 and currentTime - previousTime > interval and sensorReading >= 25){
     digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);
      knocks ++;
      previousTime = currentTime;
    }
  
    if (knocks == 4 and currentTime - previousTime > 1000){
     digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
      knocks = 0;
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>
  i then made some slight adjustments to condense the code/remove redundancies, and this was my final version:
</p>
<pre style="color:rgb(100, 209, 209)">
  const int sensor = A0;     
const int A1A = 3;
const int A1B = 4;

int sensorReading = 0;
int k = 0;         
unsigned long previousTime = 0;

long interval = 500;

void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop() {
  sensorReading = analogRead(sensor);
  unsigned long currentTime = millis();
  Serial.println(k);

  if ((sensorReading >= 100 and k == 0) or ((k == 1 or k == 2) and currentTime - previousTime > interval and sensorReading >= 25)){
    k ++;
    previousTime = currentTime;
  }

  if (k == 3 and currentTime - previousTime > interval and sensorReading >= 100){
   digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);
    k ++;
    previousTime = currentTime;
  }

  if (k == 4 and currentTime - previousTime > 1000){
   digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
    k = 0;
  }
}
</pre>

  and after uploading it to the arduino board, here it is in action:
