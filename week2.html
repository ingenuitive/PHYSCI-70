    <p>
i decided to create a 3d model of my phone and phone case, in case
i might ever in the future want to design/print an accessory for it. 
</p>

<p>
i began by measuring the dimensions of my phone with calipers, creating
a sketch, and then extruding the sketch.
</p>

<p>
unfortunately, i couldn't figure out how to properly measure the corner radius,
so i looked for the blueprints of my phone online and used the fillet
function to bring the corners in.
</p>

  <p>
i then created the extruded camera platform, as well as the camera lenses. 
i referred again to the blueprints to position the centers of the lenses.

<p>
  i then created the lock button, the volume up and down buttons, and reverse extruded a 
  hole for the volume silence switch

      as i hope will be the case for everything i produce in this class, i wanted to make a press fit kit that would have a practical use. inspired by the countless masks strewn about my common room, i decided to make a wall-mounted mask hanger.
    </p>

<p>
  my preliminary design consisted of a wall-mounted back plate with a series of hooks extruding from it. 
</p>

<p>
  i did, however, want to make the hooks attach as securely as possible, so i decided to opt for them to hook onto the back of the front place. this necessitated, then, a separate back plate that would able to be flush with the wall, and then two side pieces that could attach the front and back plates.
</p>

<p>
  i laser cut this design on cardboard and assembled it
</p>

<p>
  unfortunately, the assembly was a little loose. after mounting it on the wall, the front plate continued to fall off unless secured with tape — which was obviously cosmetically unideal.
</p>
<img src="images/pfk4.jpg">
<p>
  so i made a few adjustments — remeasuring the width and tightening the gap slightly. i also changed the side pieces to two separate connecting joints, so as to better connect the front and back plates. 
</p>

<p>
  i also added an additional interchangeable hook design. 
</p>

<p>
  i laser cut these onto wood, and assembled them (adding an engraving of my roommates initials). here is the final product:
